To pull the stats from NBA.com, I used the instructions found in this link:

Using the endpoints outlined in this article, I was able to get stats back to the year 1996 for each of the following 
categories:

basic stats for each player
basic stats for each team
advanced stats for each player
advanced stats for each team

I also downloaded a few datasets from 538's basketball stats page. This wasn't done through code.
They have a download link easily available on their webpage.
