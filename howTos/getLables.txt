To get the MVPs, I copied the list from here:
http://www.espn.com/nba/history/awards/_/id/33
back to the year 1996, then just awk'd out the columns I didn't want. 

To get the all stars, I copied this list for every decade back to 96,
then created a shell script found in the labels directory to format the stuff.
